#Notes
Some of the code were taken from SnoxdKO server project(N3Base and most of the files in the SharedFiles folder).

This will not compile is due to the encryption/decryption files are missing.

It will neither run because there's no database or map files. 
Both can be obtained by using the clients tbl files and the map files can also be obtained via the client, but for obvious reasons i will not include them here.
